# InkFloat
It's an experimental idea for an app that lets you draw or write by hand on a floating window over any app. It works offline, recognizes handwriting, and turns notes into text. Ideal for quick sketches, annotations, or converting handwritten ideas into digital text â€” all without leaving what you're doing.
